1. SUBMIT TO THE TRUTH
Imagine you are playing a basketball game and your coach is not getting through to the team.
You can tell he is frustrated because every instruction he gives seems to be either ignored or
executed incorrectly by players on the floor. So at the half he goes to the locker room and
puts on his jersey. You don't know what to think. Is he trying it on to see if it fits? Did he spill
something on his polo? And then you realize he is putting on the jersey and some shorts so he
can play in the second half. "But I thought he was the coach," you say. He is but he says to
you, "I gotta show 'em how it's done..." While this reasoning is illogical, I think it's hilarious.
This actually happened in a semi-pro game in which I played. I tried talking coach out of it but
he insisted on playing. He kind of lost the game for us that day, not because he took the last
shot and missed, which he did, but because he gave up on his role as coach. The truth is
brutal when you ignore it.
Being submitted to authority is inescapable. If you are an athlete, you have been coached and
have likely coached someone else. However, the roles of coach and player require distinctly
different commitments. The player's role is more that of executioner, setting in motion what
coaches have articulated at practice. It is not the players' job to strategize but rather to
understand strategy well enough to enact the coach's will and at times recognize when
improvisation is needed. If a play is designed to pass the ball inbounds (onto the court) and
then back to the in-bounder (person passing the ball inbounds) for a shot since he's the best
shooter, then your job as a player is to make sure the in-bounder gets the shot even if you
have to freelance a bit to do so. The player-coach relationship is all that stands between
quality competition and the kind of experience every player or team member would want to
forget.
Submission to truth means recognizing what your role is in the situation regardless of how
positive or negative. Some people love accolades while others avoid them. Some are prone to
blame themselves for everything while others refuse to accept responsibility for anything.
Needless to say, lying is the ultimate set-up and I don't mean that in a good way. Lying to
yourself is always an attempt to create your own reality and even the rich fail at that. The truth
is, if you intend to compete and win, you'll need to buy in to how much influence you have in
the environments where you serve.
Many players go on to coach but not all. Coaching requires cooperation by players and this
delicate dynamic causes many coaches to abandon hopes of leading any team to success at
any level. However, if there is one thing I have learned about coaching, it is that you cannot
think like a player when you coach. You must abandon the idea that at any moment you could
put on a jersey and just "do it for them." Coaching is the ability to draw out skill and sharpness
for the purpose of game-speed execution. Anyone can shine in practice but come game time,
will your players deliver the excellence with which they have practiced? Are they mentally
strong, physically conditioned and battle tested through intense game-like situations? Have
you created an atmosphere in practice that replicates the scenario(s) in which your players
will be asked to excel? Can you teach concepts, inspire athletes and translate team objectives
in a way that gives athletes a chance for regular success? If you can, you must. If you cannot,
it may be due to possessing a player's mentality long after your own playing days have ended.
By the same token, a player has to trust his/her coach if he intends to see his/her own
potential realized. If college basketball taught me one thing, it's that once you're on a team,
the coach is teacher and chemist. He has a system he feels will lead to success. He requests
cooperation that he has every right to demand. He's the boss whether he be a dictator or a
cupcake. His job is to transport you the same way the old stage coaches transported people
prior to the invention of the automobile. The coach is the vehicle so-to-speak and the player
is the passenger. And the truth worth submitting to is that we often do not accept authority,
the reality of our current limitations or the consequences associated with selfish ambition.
Submitting to the truth means putting down one's own ideas in favor of an honest evaluation
of specific predicaments or life in general. Name any champion and upon further investigation
you can bet that somewhere along the lines that superstar had to admit failure and perhaps
an unwillingness to change. The first step to truly competing is laying down your own agenda
and getting objective about who you are, how you play and how you see others.
2. CHECK YOUR MOTIVE
How many ballplayers have you known who "never were"? In other words, you never saw
someone with more athleticism, more ball handling skills, a "wetter" jump shot than
"so-and-so." But "so-and-so" never played one second in a real game with you because he
quit too soon. He did not like how little he was playing - wanted 35 minutes a game instead of
20. He did not expect to be disciplined for violating team rules. So he gets to tell tall tales to
his grandchildren of how some players are just too dominant to grace a high school team with
their expertise. Pardon the brief digression. This chapter poses this question: Why do you
play? Is it because of who is watching you or because your dad expects big minutes? It did not
take long for me to realize in high school and on my college team that I played for reasons
other than the immediate gratification of minutes, points, rebounds etc.
I was virtually un-recruited going into my senior season of high school. I was athletic but had
two players on my team being recruited by Pacific-10 and Western Athletic Conference
Schools. I was a low priority if a priority at all. Just before season's end I was introduced to the
coach of a Division 3 college in Orange, California. The coach seemed to like me despite my
poor showing in a game he scouted when I defended a future NBA star. I applied and started
college that fall at this particular university but seldom played. In fact, I was relegated to the
junior varsity squad. I suited up for Varsity games but did not play. The way I saw it, all
freshmen went through this. But for me, one year turned into another frustrating year. I
improved, weighted trained, shot hundreds of jump shots and still played in a unfamiliar
position (post) though I was a guard. Junior college recruits and even one freshman played
ahead of me. I often wondered why I did not quit.
In the summers I sought out college leagues to sharpen skills against better competition and
found my way onto teams with Division I caliber players. But the summer training seemed
futile as I returned to my school and sat the bench most of my sophomore and junior seasons.
I picked up garbage time minutes but never played in the crucial moments. I briefly
entertained transferring schools after my sophomore year. There was at least one local coach
of a private school near my home in the San Gabriel Valley who was interested in meeting with
me to discuss how I could help his program. I cancelled the meeting and decided to stay put
despite a chance to play on scholarship.
As a 19-year old going into my junior season I began to question whether or not transferring
schools would be running from a fight. (I have the tendency to blame myself for hardships).
When others, when I struggled to fit into the system of my college basketball program, I
thought it was some sort of puzzle that simply needed solving. I figured that my ability to
contribute to my team was contingent upon my own skill and understanding of a particular
basketball philosophy that my coach had. Leaving the school seemed like admitting that I
could not find a way to contribute at one of the lowest levels of college athletics.
Consequently, I stayed and after some playing time early in the season I once again found
myself watching most of the action. I became angry and embittered feeling trapped by a
situation that daily revealed that I was obsessed with success as defined by the number of
minutes played.
But an epiphany changed my perspective. I realized that instead of enjoying basketball
because it was fun and challenging I played to prove my worth to others. Has anyone ever told
you that you have "drama" or "baggage?" Well I did and my drama was not even related to
basketball. I put an immense amount of pressure on myself to be good because I wanted
recognition. Coaches, family and teammates were why I played.
But if I played to be heralded by onlookers, why was I suiting up for practice, giving up
countless hours only to be disappointed come game time? Answer: I started a slow process
toward understanding that I play because I enjoy how the sport makes me feel. I enjoyed
being on a team, belonging to something. Some are the "Loner" types that don't need to be
around people but that's not most people. We may pretend that we don't need people but the
truth is that there are very few hermits in the world. And I realized that I do love team-oriented
things. I also began to understand that only a select group of people ever even play college
sports. The game became more of a gift to me, something I prized in and of itself.
Every player wants to compete at a high level but why? As a younger athlete, the goal was
always simple, to be known, respected, worshiped, etc. My reasons were arrogant just like all
of yours. Don't fool yourself into thinking you're just the "competitive type". People who live by
the "all I do is win" mantra thirst for premier status. They want to be first...at every thing. I had
a severe motive deformity that evolved in high school as I sat and watched other guys
succeed in basketball for three years. Fueled by disappointment, hate and other hazardous
emotional materials, I brooded all through high school. So when college basketball became a
reality, I assumed it was the end of my "basketball wilderness." But the motive to compete was
anything but committed to being the best that I could be. It sounds like a line from a movie but
we must understand that we either operate from internal or external stimuli. When the
external motivation to play is not provided, it is then that you must determine your value for
the game itself. Is it worth playing TO YOU?
And that question is the point of this chapter. Is the team on which you play worth your time? I
am not asking you if you feel your teammates are worthless or if you perceive that you are
better than the team for which you play. Rather, I am asking you the same question I asked
myself, "Are you playing for the wrong reasons?" If you play because you start the game,
because people admire you or even because you need to go pro to save your family from
poverty, perhaps you are risking the loss of your satisfaction with the game itself. Plainly
stated, you were once satisfied with the game in its purest form. The smell of the wood floor,
the feel of the ball when it leaves your hands, the sound of squeaky feet shuffling to make
plays and even the hollow sound of dribbling are among the sensory details we all enjoy most
about basketball.
Perhaps your sport is not basketball but hopefully the application of this lesson is universal. It
is in your control to enjoy the sport and teammates. How often a coach plays you is not within
your control. It is in your control to prepare yourself physically and mentally for competition. It
is outside of your control to determine how high up you are in a professional draft. On any
given day, remember that your best is usually something no team can afford to do without.
Lest you think that I am prescribing that you learn how to like losing, relax. I will address
vindication in the last chapter. Where does all this stuff get you in the long run? You'll find out.
3. PREPARE
As alluded to earlier, I rode enough benches in high school and college to supply a year's
worth of firewood from my buttocks to a small family in Alaska. If there is one thing I learned
from NOT playing basketball it's how to prepare. Are you good at remembering names? Maybe
you are an auditory learner. Can you watch someone do something once and then replicate it?
Maybe you are a visual learner. Do you need to physically perform a task before you feel
confident with the activity? Maybe your learning style is what is known as bodily-kinesthetic.
Knowing how you prefer to learn is important to preparation. What is more important is that
you engage your learning style once you know what it is.
I can't speak for other sports but in college basketball, often times if you do not play in the
games, you are probably not playing in practice scrimmages either. This was the case for me
both in college. Our practice uniforms were black and white. Starters wore black and the
second team was in white jerseys. I was in and out of the white group and did not elevate to
black status until my senior year. So, being a bodily-kinesthetic learner, I had difficulty
mastering concepts because I could only hear them taught and/or see them demonstrated. I
am a learner who needs to "do it" first. The result was that when it was my turn to do a drill or
run a play I made mistakes. It looked like I was not paying attention and coach usually
commented on these things. Comment is a euphemism for "He blew up at us for not paying
attention." At such a rate I could never become a better player so I did what any struggling
student does. I got a tutor. We had ex-players (alumni) who assisted my head coach and I had
them literally walk me through plays in slow motion. You know what happens when you pursue
a tutor? The tutor teaches and tells the coach how much you want to learn. Not only do you
master offensive and defensive schemes but you gain the respect of the head coach. Whether
he plays you in the next game or not, your stock with coach goes up. And I realized I valued
the respect of my coach more than minutes on the floor though the two eventually will
intersect.
While NOT playing basketball, I figured out that if I was going to learn the game better than
the players on the floor I would have to understand the sport on my own terms and at my own
pace. The players on the floor have the advantage of learning on the fly, while engaged in
game-time situations. When you're the guy who is two-to-three players removed from being
in the playing rotation, the game and its greater implications become more striking if you pay
attention. For example, the details of playing one-on-one defense became clear the more I
was tutored. The assistants took time to show me flaws in my footwork and methods for how I
could be successful and break into the playing line-up. They had the eyes to see my blind
spots and it was surprising to find that they actually wanted me to thrive. One of the greatest
deceptions we face daily is that everyone has it in for us - that help is unavailable when we
need it. The will to prepare is crucial in changing a situation you find undesirable. You must
invite help if you intend to prepare like a champion. The best you have improves the team and
preparation means you will exhaust yourself to learn and execute because this will make the
team better. This became my only motivation during a period in my career when I could not
guarantee how much I would play during games.
Ronny Turiaf, who played for the New York Knicks at the time this was written, is another prime
example of preparation meeting opportunity. Turiaf played power forward for the Los Angeles
Lakers until 2007-08 and was known for his eccentric celebratory displays after an assist by a
teammate or a 3-pointer drained by Kobe Bryant. Early in the season he was not the sixth or
seventh man off the bench. He was much further down but as the season progressed, it was
clear that he knew exactly where to be on the floor, how to position himself for key defensive
blocked shots and scoring opportunities on the other end of the floor. He studied with a tutor.
The result could be summed up by a play he made in the first round of the 2006-07 NBA
playoffs against the Phoenix Suns. Turiaf battled Amare Stoudemire for a rebound, knocked
the ball loose, picked it up and without dribbling exploded to dunk viciously over one of the
best forwards in the game. For all that he has learned not being a starter, he has earned a
reputation as an energizer who plays with unrelenting passion while exhibiting a high
basketball I.Q. Oh, did I mention that he had open heart surgery just months after he was
drafted in 2005?
4. BLAME YOURSELF FOR SOMETHING
This chapter is about blame and I do not know Elmer G. Letterman but he is quoted as saying,
"A man may fall many times but he won't be a failure until he says someone pushed him."
Funny. There is still a tendency to respond to such wit, "But what if someone really did push
me... isn't that my validation?" It is not validation but rather an excuse to remain mediocre at
best. Blame is a mentality, a way of being and a practice that strips people of the power God
gave them.
The fourth lesson I learned from not playing basketball is that, it's never always someone
else's fault. My college coach stunned me early in my freshman year at a practice when he
told us all that bad passes are the passer's fault. I thought to myself, "What if my guy has
terrible hands or cuts to the basket with his head turned the wrong way? If he drops it, that's
on him right, Coach?" Coach said that he was tired of players blaming other people for their
own poor decisions on the floor. "My teammate did not help me when I was beaten
one-on-one." Coach had a drill to ensure you did not get beaten one-on-one. "I could not
take a charge because the referees called me for three early fouls and I did not want a
fourth." Coach really hated that excuse so one day he stood in the key and let all 13 of us run
him over. He took a charge from every one of us to prove that doing the right thing is a
decision that anyone can make for the sake of the team.
In my college program, we did a 1-on-1 drill called "1-on-1 in the key." The drill was simple.
Stop three guys in a row before your defensive tenure is up. The only way out of the key was
to throw a hard chest pass to an offensive player, close out on him and stop him from scoring
using sound defensive principles. If you fouled him, you went back to zero stops. If you got
beaten, you went back to zero. If you missed a block-out or gave up a rebound your stint on
defense could feel like a sentence to the underworld of Greek mythology – eternal.
The concept was simple. Basketball is a game of competing. As a 17-year-old freshman, I
learned that blaming others only postponed a confrontation with personal truth. Coach
redefined "competing" as doing the right thing at the right time with maximum intensity. To
compete is to execute technique rehearsed in practice. It entails, for instance, telling a
teammate he is being screened and helping on his man long enough to prevent an easy
bucket. The principle of competing in every minute detail was the way in which my college
coach attempted to garner selflessness in a team environment.
The lesson here is that blaming other people borders on insanity. In a game situation, you are
the one guarding these offensive players so who will you blame? The technique for stopping
an offensive player is not difficult to learn but feels physically unnatural. So I remember
dreading this drill. I remember spending 30-45 minutes trying to stifle my fatigue and finish
my sentence. It sucked. Nevertheless, I learned how to play defense. I'm 35 years old at the
time of this book's writing and the way I teach and play defense was shaped by the "blame"
lesson coach taught us be in the 1990s.
Blaming others does not teach us anything except how to shirk responsibility. Shouldering
responsibility ensures that you get the tools needed for the game. All things equal, you should
never fail in a contest if you have accepted the cost of preparation. Mastery of skills,
information, concepts, etc. all lead to a performance of which one can be proud. Blaming
others is a tool of deflection as much as it is a tool of deception. If we concentrated on what
we control half as much as what we do not, our production would be exponentially increased.
It's never always someone else's fault but it is always within one's power to "compete." That
seems ironic but it is not. The someone you are blaming is often someone different and you
are the one constant in every experience you have ever had in life.
Surely the probability of every botched experience being the result of someone's ineptitude
must be astronomical. Again, you are the common denominator. You have private access to
your thoughts and your physical abilities. You have consciousness. You are in control of far
more than you realize. Humans can calculate the orbit, Velcro and telescopes that orbit the
Earth but strangely find ourselves incapable of so much. To blame is to insult how we are
created. I learned this good lesson from the best seat in the house – next to coach.
5. RESOLVE TO COMPETE
An article on https://www.google.com/search?q=Ezinearticles.com said this concerning anger:
"Angry people have a certain perception and expectation of the world that they live in and
when that reality does not meet their expectation of it, then they become angry." (Tristan Loo,
What Causes Anger?)
It seems that anger is synonymous with displeasure. When it surfaces, it aggressively
attempts to interrupt or punish the source of the displeasure. What is noteworthy is that
perception has much to do with describing the emotion of anger. Perception provokes a
feeling. For example, a woman could step on her husband's eyeglasses and upset him. But if
he found that she stepped on his glasses because she had accidentally set herself on fire, he
might be less prone to accuse her of malicious intent. In other words, he would not be mad at
his burning wife because he perceives that she was merely trying to put herself out when she
stepped on his glasses. Perception matters.
I learned this truth NOT playing basketball and found that anger is as common as breathing. It
is not said that anger impedes domination by providing us an internal gauge for how much
"crap" we will actually take. But I offer this. Anger in its truest sense must prompt one to
actively improve himself and his environment. Anger is a common emotion that I remember
experiencing in sports as early as about age 8. We have it as babies, undoubtedly exhibited
through tantrums, but I never noticed how much it involved perception until I played college
basketball. By the time I was a sophomore in college, I had anger associated with
self-validation that was six years in the making. In high school I only played quality minutes as
a senior. That means I sat the bench for three years and then finally got to play. The more
athletic I became, the less I understood about my inability to secure playing time and this is
where discontent turned into anger.
My anger symptoms consisted mainly of resentment, apathy and diminished concentration. I
hated my teammates for making mistakes, pretended not to care about team objectives and
found it difficult to learn in practice. I perceived that somehow I was destined to fail. It was as
if the entire world knew I was a horrible basketball player masquerading as a good one. The
fear was that maybe I really did think I was better than I actually was. I could see myself being
a fraud and this sickened me. However, before long I discovered that I could not be a fraud if I
was "capable." I would learn in college that capability is not defined by minutes played but by
effort in competing, time in preparation and precision in execution.
As a sophomore looking to develop over the summer before my junior season three things
became a physical priority: 1. ball handling, 2. shooting and 3. agility. I dribbled, shot and
worked out more than any of the previous years before a season but was met with
disappointment at the start of the regular season. The less I played the angrier I got and the
more determined I became to add superior skills to my basketball repertoire.
An interesting reality check always occurs when you have the control to obtain what you want
but instead only get angry. The reality check involves your motives and questions whether or
not you are disappointed or vested in changing what you perceive is wrong. Anger is an
impetus meant to inspire and protect. Anger is what helps you beat up the bully. If we are not
willing to improve ourselves and our environments (i.e. social, work, home, etc.) then we are
unfit to be angry. Anger is an intense emotion that accompanies the release of adrenaline in
some instances. Anger can inflict misery but it can also provide a catalyst for necessary
change. This revelation led me to alter how I processed anger.
In lieu of being a cancer to the team, I decided that I would hone and utilize my skills to
become a dominant practice player. Make no mistake, I did not want to be a practice player. I
did not dream of telling my grandkids about the time in practice when I ran a sprint or almost
made a shot. But since playing time was outside of my control, I opted to control what I could.
So I asked myself: Could I improve the quickness of my first step so that my drive to the
basket was indefensible? Could I make eighty percent of my shots in drills without defense on
me and 50 percent with someone guarding me? Could I guard players heavier than me by
improving footwork and hand positioning? Personal challenges became channels for my
anger. I truly competed against myself and over the remainder of my basketball career, I
attempted to win the battle of useless vs. useful anger.
6. RESPECT UP, DOWN & ACROSS
A.C. Green is a name synonymous with integrity in the NBA. He is known by two claims to
fame. The first is that, along with his three championship rings, he holds the Iron Man record
for most consecutive games played – 1192 straight from 1986 to 1999. The second thing that
distinguished A.C. Green from other athletes was his commitment to abstinence before
marriage.
As an Inglewood native, I naturally became a Lakers fan. I was raised during the "Showtime"
era with Ervin "Magic" Johnson at the helm. But A.C. Green was a crucial cog in the Lakers
basketball machine during this time and toward the end of his career I read one of his books.
The lesson I learned was undoubtedly the key to A.C.'s success as a respected power forward
in the NBA. The lesson, which was one of Green's 52 keys to championship living, was
"Respect life. Respect your opponent. Respect yourself. Victories are not cheap."
Early in my basketball career I used anger to fuel performance because I had little or no
regard for those against whom I played. I resented teammates who played more minutes if I
thought they were inferior players. My loyalty was to my perceived ability and athleticism.
Furthermore, by the time I began playing college basketball it was clear that arrogance was a
part of my athletic personality. I thought that if I exuded confidence and expected to dominate
opponents I could intimidate them. My freshman year of college I bloodied my knuckles a
couple of times by punching bleachers after losing pick-up games. I cursed at opposing
players, made excuses when I did not perform well and was visibly embarrassed about playing
at a Division III university. I mean, clearly I was good enough to play Division I basketball. The
problem was, apparently every Division I school in the country was ignorant of this fact along
with the Division II coaches.
One afternoon I remember my weight coach pulling me aside and saying, "Coulter,
relaaaaaaax" with his face forming a half-smile. I had just taken another shot at the bleachers
and was proceeding to spiral into a temper tantrum. To me his instructions were
inconceivable. After all, coach, can you not see that I eclipse the talent in the gym? How can I
"relaaaax" when my career is at stake? I want to play as a freshman, score points and make an
impact so I can transfer to the kind of school where I belong. I was, in a word, selfish and
unable to recognize that until I respected the ability of my opponents I would never hone my
craft as a basketball player.
Why is respect for one's opponent needed? It is absolutely necessary because "respect"
makes one cautious. By definition, to respect someone is to acknowledge that he or she
possesses worth, excellence, ability and skill. The acknowledgment is needed information that
should lead to a pursuit of excellence that rivals or exceeds that of the opponent. In other
words, if you respect that your opponent is good, you will prepare yourself well enough to win
no matter who you face.
This became apparent during my college career. My opponents were all of the other freshmen
and walk-on athletes trying to make the team. But instead of making an impact, I spent my
freshman season playing on a junior varsity team. This meant I did not travel with the regular
team nor play in their games. I suited up for varsity and got to play against other junior varsity
teams that served as training wheels for guys like me. I learned to respect all teams no matter
how they appeared to match up against us. I learned that I was not too good to concentrate
on the details of the game. I realized that whenever you compete, the opposition has
prepared the same as you. The test is to see who is more prepared rather than to discover if
you can win because you are more gifted. Respect says that you understand how difficult
competition is and that you are prepared to do battle with a worthy opponent. On several
different occasions I failed to make it into the playing rotation of my college team. I exhibited
disrespect and played reckless basketball, a sign that I needed this chapter's lesson.
Aggression is easier to summon than respect but when combined they result in the highest
level of performance. Humans are built to flee or fight when threatened so I understand why
anger usually breeds aggression. But as I learned how to both respect the opponent and play
aggressively, something became very clear. It is not logical to fight your own team. Let me
explain. I realized that anything I do to hurt my team qualifies as fighting against my own
squad. If I get into a fist fight with my point guard, I am fighting the team. If I talk back to a
referee and receive a technical foul, I am fighting my team. If I am jealous of the starters I am
fighting my team. These examples could be called "negative aggression." But "positive
aggression" is when you study your opponent while perfecting your own craft. When I have
respect for other competitors I am assuming that they have dedicated themselves to
preparation so I must put myself in a position to be my best. With respect and aggression
combined, I will pay attention to diet, rest, specific skill practice and scouting. I came to
understand that when an athlete maintains respect for others, he is less likely to make
excuses for his own performance later.
7. SHOW SOME I.D.
I like when people tell me I am doing a good job at something and in contrast, I hate when
people are displeased with my performance. My college coach often said, "If you don't do
what I'm asking you to do there's only two explanations. Either you refuse to do it or you are
too stupid to do it." That sounds harsh but it sure makes you want to do things the correct
way or at least ask a coach questions that will improve your play. When I heard coach's theory
it made me ask myself, "Am I making mistakes in practice because I do not understand or
because I refuse to be coached?" I found it was often the latter of the two. Deep within, I
thought I could sway coach into changing his basketball program to fit my style of play. I
thought wrong based on my perception of something called the self.
A pastor I once knew said that there are three perceptions of the self: the self others see, the
self you see and the self God sees. He said that only one of these "selfs" really matters. Can
you guess which one? However, in high school, college and beyond I wanted to be known as
an athlete, a premier basketball player. I carried a basketball around in class in high school
and practiced my autograph. I dribbled home every day, signed yearbooks with my #22 as a
suffix and downplayed my honors classes as if I was ashamed of my intelligence. People
signed my yearbook, "Hope to see you on TV one day." Mission accomplished. I had achieved
an exterior self and those who had never even seen me play identified me as a basketball
player.
My perception of my self, the second of the three, was that I was severely underrated and
deserving of more attention as an athlete. But in retrospect, after watching old film and
observing myself in head-to-head competition with other players I realized that my own
assessment of my game was not honest. The truth was that I was a young unpolished player
with an inconsistent mid-range jump-shot, good quickness and average jumping ability for my
size. I encountered a four-inch growth spurt as a 14-year-old that may have stiffened me a bit
and I was anything but poetry in motion. The truth is that I was not physically ready to
contribute to my high school's varsity team until the summer before my junior year. However,
there were returning varsity players who would likely round out the rotation during the
upcoming season. I competed well enough to make the varsity my junior year but I certainly
was not good enough to oust any of the returning players.
The true self is the third self and the only one that matters. Some reading this book may not
subscribe to a system of religious beliefs but as human beings, we all try to understand our
world, and more specifically, ourselves within that world. When we're driven to examine
ourselves truthfully and intimately, there is humility and triumph. You discover your most
glaring flaws but reveal harmful pretenses. While trying to create an image before others and
feeling sorry for myself I always feared that I was the liar. Perhaps it was not coach's fault for
not playing me. Perhaps I was limited athletically and was not created to be Lebron James.
Have you ever considered that sports may not be your destiny? It is a tough reality to face but
we must learn to be flexible about our futures when we gain a view of the true self.
In 1999 I boarded a plane to return to the United States from the Philippines. I had spent two
weeks there securing a tryout for a team in their top-level professional basketball league. I
was not picked up by the team and on the way home I appealed to my faith in Jesus Christ for
insight. My view of the true self began to take shape. I accepted the truth – that my loving
creator deserves to have control. Furthermore, I acknowledged that the one who created me
would never allow me to rest in a false sense of identity. It would be criminal for the God of the
universe to let me live a lie. And rather than attempting to force a career as a basketball player,
I applied to graduate school and two years later completed a Masters degree.
My education coupled with accepting myself for who I really am, a basketball loving guy with a
desire to see people discover their true purpose, has allowed me great opportunity. It has also
given me freedom to focus my energy on helping those who are involved in athletics to gain a
right perspective about sports. I have learned that sports is meant to serve us and not vice
versa. Lessons like teamwork, discipline, respect, perseverance are real and timeless. I will
never be mediocre because of the lessons afforded to me by basketball. Pretending to be
something you're not...well that's just ridiculous. Know thy self.
8. FIND YOUR VALUE
By the time I finished playing college basketball, the statistics compiled by our sports
information director said that I shot better than 52 percent from the field over four years. That
sounds pretty good. If you know anything about hoop you know that making 50 percent of
your shots is a good thing. That stat was misleading however because I probably averaged
less than five minutes per game playing time from my freshman through junior seasons. You
check the record books of my alma mater and my name will not be found under highest field
goal percentage. Consider the next lesson in our journey – self worth.
Confidence is essential for a competitor. He or she must believe that what has been practiced
can be repeated in a game situation. But what happens when the competitor finds him or
herself on the bench or sideline unable to prove that they are capable? Confidence cannot be
gained in one's own mind. It must be made concrete through a series of successful
experiences. For instance, the more you ride a bike without falling, the more confident you
become that you will ride without falling. You cannot simply think you will not fall but rather
you must physically ride and actually stay on the bike if you are to gain confidence.
In the fall of my sophomore year of college, a classmate asked if I had ever written anything in
the school newspaper. I said no and she asked if I would like to do so. I said, "sure thing." What
I thought was a one-time venture turned into two and a half years of writing/editing for the
school's weekly publication along with my major course of study. I ended up getting a degree
in English with an emphasis in print journalism. So what's the lesson? I found confidence in
writing, something other than basketball. The discovery was accidental but unmistakably
necessary. To this day I am confident that I can communicate with most anyone.
If you are like me it is easy to want athletic success so bad that it becomes all you do.
Remember how in junior high they made you play all sports during P.E. class? But by the time
you are in high school, perhaps you only play one sport because you are determined to make
yourself good at it. In college, I found that classmates, fellow athletes, faculty etc. were
offering the utmost respect for my writing ability despite my woes on the basketball court. By
my junior year I was editor of the sports paper on the way to eventually writing for real
newspapers once I graduated.
I found my confidence in an area unrelated to basketball but writing played a significant part
in making me the confident person I am today. Whether talking with Chief Executive Officers
of major companies or playing basketball with some kids in Metro Manila, Philippines I have
enjoyed communicating confidently with people from various backgrounds. I bear no shame
about my failed attempts to play in the NBA because I am not defined by one activity anymore.
None of us are. We must remember that confidence is essential for those wanting to
contribute to the world around them. You must find places from which you can draw
confidence. If you do not play as much during games as you desire, in what other activities do
you find success? Maybe your area of expertise right now is an academic subject, boy/girl
scouting, church ministry, business ideas, etc. These "others" are valuable and they say as
much or more about you as any sport ever could.
9. WAIT WITH YOUR HEAD UP
I mentioned earlier that I grew up a Los Angeles Lakers fan and this has not changed. I play
pick-up games wearing crew socks with the Lakers logo on them. I still quote the late Chick
Hearn and reminisce about the glory days of Lakers vs. Celtics. But one of my best Lakers
memories was in the summer of 1996. It was rumored that Shaquille O'Neal was attempting to
work out a trade from the Orlando Magic to the Lakers. I was in Oakland, California visiting
friends when the news of the trade being finalized hit the newspapers. What do you think I
talked about for the next 24 hours straight? We got Shaq. We got Shaq.
Shaq is no longer a Laker but for eight years (1996-2004) the Lakers re-established
themselves as a power in the Western Conference of the NBA. They won three straight
championships from 2000-2002. But all of this was made possible because one dominant
player carefully evaluated his career and changed teams in the off-season. The natural
question I am tempted to ask of anyone who changes teams in the off-season is, "Did they
evaluate carefully or did they quit?" As a preface for the lesson in this chapter we must
acknowledge that there is a fine line between quitting and changing teams for good reason.
Perhaps Orlando Magic fans were not as pleased with Shaq's departure as I was with his
arrival. They may have viewed him as someone abandoning a franchise primed for another run
at the NBA title. Nevertheless, Shaq may have made the best choice for his career and his
family.
When a player leaves a team at the professional level it often has to do with one of two things:
money and/or an opportunity to win a championship. After being swept in the NBA Finals by
the Houston Rockets in 1995, Shaq undoubtedly desired another chance at a championship.
He had to decide if he would get such an opportunity in Orlando or would he stand a better
chance somewhere else. He chose Los Angeles as a possibility with its history of winning and
current distress. By the time Shaq joined the team in L.A. the days of "Showtime" were long
gone. The Lakers were not a viable Western Conference contender in the mid-90s but Shaq
apparently saw an opportunity to rebuild a franchise. He evaluated carefully and made his
move. It resulted in three championships. In 2004-2005 he moved again and it resulted in
another championship with the Miami Heat.
I learned the lesson of changing teams in the off-season after my opportunity to do so
passed. As is the focus of this book, I learned much from NOT playing basketball but in the
summer of 1995 I was recruited by another college that may have offered me significantly
more playing time. Because college teams are not allowed to practice in the summer, I played
near my home in the San Gabriel Valley area of Southern California. There were several
colleges in my region but I played at one most often and caught the attention of an assistant
coach. To make a long story short, I scheduled a meeting with the coaches of this university
and I was told I could red shirt one year but play big minutes the following two.
The school recruiting me said I could earn a scholarship and emphasized the benefit of
playing in a Christian environment, something I felt I needed. It would have been risky to leave
my current school, but what did I have to lose? I was playing very little and had only recently
decided on a major. I was attempting to practice my faith in Christianity at my current
university but felt unsupported. I had clear cause to make the jump from one team to another
and had even secured the blessing of my current coach, not that losing a benchwarmer would
have mattered much. At any rate, on the day of the meeting I called the prospective university
and told them I did not wish to leave where I was. I did the opposite of Shaq.
I will never know what would have come of the transfer from one school to another.
Nevertheless, the lesson is simple: Do not let fear determine the moves you make when new
opportunities arise. Chance came of me staying at the university where I struggled to get
playing time? I will answer that better in the final chapter. But I met my wife through a college
friend whom I would not have met had I left. There are losses when you leave an environment
in favor of a new one but there is a scripture that reads, "Do you not know that in a race all the
runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize (I Corinthians
9:24)." Whether you stay or change teams, you should evaluate your motives carefully and
then make your decision with confidence that you are doing it for all the right reasons.
10. MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS
The word comparison is often understood as noting the similarities and differences between
two things. Commonly, however, the term compare is used to identify differences between
people that distinguish one of the persons as inferior to the other. We have all probably said,
"Compared to so-and-so I am..." I have spent a lifetime using others as a benchmark to see
how I match up. Am I as strong, quick, as good a shooter, etc. as him? Is my scoring average or
field goal percentage higher than his? The list of comparisons is seemingly endless. But is it
worth our time?
Well, one thing about time that remains constant is that we all have a mere 86,400 seconds
available to us each day. Being rich, pretty or popular will not change this. Time is time and
how you spend it is up to you. This lesson concerns the type of comparisons in which you
engage each day. After all, if a comparison is helpful, then it is a good use of our 86,400
seconds. If it moves us forward and does not make us hate the teammate next to us then it is
a good comparison.
As a high school varsity basketball player I had one of the greatest scoring guards I have ever
known on my team. He was a phenomenal leaper meaning he had "crazy bounce." Even at
only 6 feet in height, his incredible jumping ability allowed him to average probably one dunk
per game and at least two blocked shots. I remind you that this guy was a guard.
Not only could this guy jump but he had a pure jump shot from mid and 3-point range, a
deceptive quick first step to the basket and the ability to drive to the basket with body control
that avoided the charge and finished plays. He averaged about 18 points a game because he
was unselfish but had the potential to put up big numbers. It was difficult to go through
practice and not compare yourself to him. At six feet and five inches I was taller than him and
could bench press more than him but I did not have one school recruiting me until spring of
my senior year. He, on the other hand, was pursued by several Pacific 10 and Western Athletic
Conference Schools. He was headed for a Division I university after playing three years of
varsity basketball. I only played two years of varsity basketball and sat the bench for one of
those. I was jealous of my teammate in the worst way.
I made these types of comparisons long after high school but learned in college that my
comparisons were better spent on pointing out the differences between myself and ... myself. I
was honest with myself about my highly recruited high school teammate, his abilities were
superior to mine in various areas. But our style of play and roles on the team were quite
different. I became more of the utility player who could guard all five positions and run the
floor without fatigue. I scored in transition off of fast breaks and offensive rebounding. My
teammate generated his own offense. Once I realized how different we were I learned to
compete against my own personal bests.
For instance, if I can make six out of 10 17-foot jump-shots with no one guarding me then I will
work toward improving to seven out of ten by the end of the month. Another useful
comparison I developed later in my career was to try and make multiple shots in-a-row before
a miss. If I consistently can make three shots in-a-row before a miss then my new goal
becomes four. The goal is now based on personal bests—not a person. Comparisons to
people often make us disrespectful or envious, two characteristics that damage our ability to
properly prepare for competition. As mentioned earlier, we want to respect our opponents
and play aggressively. Comparing yourself to yourself is the best way to do both of those
things.
Comparisons off the court may sound like this: "I am not as athletic as my brother, I am not as
smart as my sister or I am not musical like my mom." These are just as dangerous as the
calculations I used to make between myself and my high school teammate. The reason is that
you could be enjoying life and each day's 86,400 seconds if you were not so busy devaluing
yourself. We must learn to value how we are created even if the greater part of society pays
others more attention.
Consider this analogy using the dessert strawberry shortcake as an example. It is one of my
favorites, but what if suddenly people hated it and avoided all who still ate it? Is it possible to
enjoy strawberry shortcake even though it is unpopular? Stupid question, right? If it was
against the law to eat your favorite dessert you would be sneaking into the bathroom stalls at
school buying pieces of German chocolate cake on the black market.
Today, the only comparisons I find useful are myself to Jesus Christ and myself today to
myself yesterday. What do I have in common with the most perfect person whoever lived?
What do I do differently than him? Is my performance today improved? If not, I know where to
make adjustments. If you are serious about making yourself truly competitive, learn the lesson
of avoiding pointless comparisons. Set comparative goals that focus on improving YOU and
YOU will fair better on the day you are tested in a game.
11. DON'T CONFUSE THE AUDIENCE
Another lesson I learned from not playing basketball is that people are watching you all the
time whether you consider yourself important or not. I've found that people are always looking
for role models, ways to improve. It is as if they're looking at themselves by comparing
themselves to you. And while society does categorize us from elites to the "every man,"
chances are that teammates, friends and even strangers are paying attention to what you say
you represent and how you represent it. Throughout my life I have found that people watch
you constantly and often see the good to which you are oblivious.
My first example comes from eighth grade Pop Warner Football. I lived in south Los Angeles.
In the fall of 1988 my mother, sister and I were living with a woman from our church who took
us in after an unfortunate turn of events left us without a home. The kids in my neighborhood
were all legends in their own minds - myself included. The Lakers, Dodgers, Raiders and an
occasional reference to professional wrestling rounded out most conversations. We played
football in the street along with basketball and baseball.
The lady we lived with had a chain-link fence surrounding her home and whenever I was
leaving her front yard, I would leap over the fence rather than open it. It was a challenge and I
at least "wowed" myself with each leap. Little did I know that Mr. Porter across the street was
watching. He saw the moves in the pick-up football games, the fence hops and probably more
than that and one day asked if I had ever played real tackle football. I said no and he asked if I
would like to give it a shot. I said sure. Mr. Porter said I looked pretty athletic the way I hopped
that fence. I had no idea anybody was watching but I had a great time that year playing tight
end for the Cardinals. I caught a couple of touchdowns and got to be a part of a nearly
undefeated team because somebody was watching me when I was unaware.
Skipping ahead several years to college there were multiple instances when I was being
watched while unaware. Early during my senior season, I would look over little index cards
before each game to calm my nerves. I was anxious about facing the opponent. In others I
was not sure how much coach was planning to play me that game. The index cards had
scriptures on them and all 52 principles of Championship Living that appeared in A.C. Green's
book Victory. The scriptures and principles on these cards were purely personal, helping me
deal with my anger and depression. It was so much of a routine that I no longer realized I was
doing anything out of the ordinary. I just carried the cards in my pocket with a nasty, old
rubber band double-wrapped around them.
How did I know I was being watched while I read these cards? One-by-one various teammates
began to ask me what was on these cards. They wanted to take a look so I would hand a few
over and at that point I realized what I did mattered. We did not discuss the content much and
I did not become a street preacher. But I could feel some respect generated as the guys
playing more minutes than me understood a little bit better what I was going through. As a
senior I still wanted to play just as bad as when I was an angry freshman beating up the
bleachers with my fist. The experience with my teammates and the index cards helped me to
see that others observe the example rather than the words of leadership.
Yet another example that reinforces the lesson of this chapter was based on something a
friend revealed to me after we graduated from college. As in most college campuses and
locker rooms, particularly among males, the conversation usually included alcohol and drug
use. There is also a certain crass humor that takes place in dormitories and locker rooms,
particularly among males. Like many athletes, I enjoyed being around other ball- players no
matter what sport they played. I attended parties but was known as the guy who did not drink
or do the things that came with the territory of partying. To the point, my friend and former
roommate told me that when I would enter a room where drinking, smoking, dirty-joking, etc.
was taking place guys would spot me and say, "Hey straighten up, Norman's coming."
I was shocked. I am no physical individual by any stretch but it became clear to me once again
that people were watching me. I felt unimportant most of my college career because I defined
myself solely as a basketball player but others apparently saw more. They saw someone who
valued morality and some of the more traditional virtues. Again, I did not see myself as a
worthwhile example to anyone but others were watching. People used words like: inspired,
hard- working and decent to describe a guy who battled rage inside himself everyday. There
were times when I hated my coach and everyone else around me but dealt with the struggles
inwardly. Even though I was not known around campus as an impact player who carried the
team, there was respect among my fellow students for the type of man I was becoming.
My final example for this lesson, easily one of my favorites, is totally unrelated to college or
basketball. I will keep this one brief. As I left church service one day in 1996 I was feeling like a
failure. I was not involved in church at the time as I had been in earlier years. Neither was I
living what I would consider the best example of a Christian life. That means I had girls on the
brain. Also, in a freakish turn of events one year earlier, my pastor had suddenly died of a
severe asthma attack leaving his wife and two children. I'm not sure where I was with God at
this point in my life. All I could muster on a weekly basis was to attend church. On this day,
however, a woman I knew from the church saw me in the parking lot and asked if she could
share something with me. She thought she was freaking me out and truthfully ... she was. I
stopped and listened. She reluctantly said that God wanted me to know that he considered
me faithful. "Despite how you are feeling," she said, "you are faithful and God is pleased with
you." If this was a joke it was far from funny. I received her words with kindness. It was further
proof that while you may feel worthless, someone is watching with admiration, even the great
God of heaven. How you handle yourself is being documented by people all around you and it
matters because the world is, quite frankly, short of genuinely solid people who do the right
thing. Will you be the one that people observe and choose to admire? Or will you be the kind
of person that people look at and pray that they never become?
12. BE VERIFIED BY TENACITY
PART 1
At last I submit the last of the 12 lessons I learned from NOT playing basketball. If you do not
quit, the truth of who you are will be proven – verified. I learned one of my most notable
lessons about life from an encounter I had with my coach after the last game of my college
career. It is actually a difficult thing to recount because of how desperately I wanted to excel
in basketball as a young person. As mentioned earlier, I prided myself on training and
improving my basketball acumen. But as also discussed in this book, I found little tangible
success as a player to compare with my expectations. Every year was supposed to be that
year where people would finally acknowledge that I was a dominant player.
As a teen, I would have done almost anything, trained anywhere, forsaken friend and family to
attain a Division I scholarship. The reality for me, however, was years of hard work that
resulted in hard-earned minutes on the basketball court. I never played as much as I wanted
to until I was attempting to play professionally through semi-pro ventures. I earned every bit of
playing time I ever received. Nevertheless, something interesting happened after a game on
the way to the team van in the winter of 1997.
We completed a game in northern California against an average opponent and I played well. I
easily had a double-double in points and rebounds and a couple of steals to add. Naturally
the seniors played the majority of minutes since it was our final game and team morale was
up. It had been a long season due to conflicts of personality but we had posted a winning
season. Playoffs were out of the picture so it was a sentimental moment of finality to realize I
would never play another college game.
We greeted some of our fans from southern California who made the trip, gathered our
belongings and headed for the vans that would take us back to our hotel. I noticed that my
coach was on my left as I walked out of the gymnasium and could tell there was something he
wanted to say. I could not imagine what it was but thought that he might have wanted to
comment on how I played hard that night. He went a bit deeper.
What he basically told me that night was that he had messed up over my four-year stint at the
university. He said he had played me out of position for most of the time I was in school and
that he wasted my ability to contribute to the team. I was dumbfounded. In part I was relieved
to find that during my college career I had been disgruntled for good reason. In effect I was
good enough to impact the team and help us win. At least that is what I thought coach was
saying.
On the other hand, I felt that he was too late in even admitting these observations because my
college eligibility was up. I felt cheated for a second and struggled for several months to make
sense of the emotions I was experiencing. Did coach waste my ability or was I missing the big
picture? The answer came over time and I began to realize years later that I had gained
tremendous wisdom from my basketball career.
The question I had always asked myself from childhood to adulthood was, "Am I a good
basketball player?" In my mind there was only one thing that determined the answer to this
question – playing time. If you do not play, I thought, you are a worthless athlete who should
not be issued a uniform. But in the few moments I spent with coach on that February night in
1997 the opposite became true. I was absolutely a good basketball player with a future in the
sport but I was more than that. I was skilled, respected and coachable. I could boast that I
never quit despite adversity and all because my coach came to me in humility and admitted
that he made a mistake.
I cherish that moment and this final lesson. It is because of that one conversation that I wrote
this book for anyone who has ever felt useless. Each of the 12 lessons only increased my
tenacity and fervor for competition. I am far more demanding of my student athletes than any
coach ever was of me and its because of the 12 lessons. As an educator, I encourage students
to find what motivates them about a subject. If someone has to make you do something, you
will never do it well. But if you find your own reasons for shooting, dribbling, reading, studying,
etc... you will prove yourself unstoppable. You will exude a healthy confidence that does not
tear others apart but seeks to build. You will listen when others hurt and you will understand
their pain. You will prepare for competition like your life depended on it but most importantly,
you will enjoy the process.
I do not remember very many specific games or even practice sessions. What I do recall over
my 21 years of playing basketball are the drills, the people, the polished techniques, the highfives, the coaches, the jokes...the game in its purest form. I enjoy hoop because of all of 12 of
these lessons and enjoying hoop allows me to see my life's big picture. I am a part of a family
just like you who are reading this. Family could be blood relatives, friends or teammates. My
family is part of a community which is part of a society which is part of a world to whom I
stand to contribute my best. The world needs the best that I can give and will never compare
what I have given to what someone else has. The lessons have reminded me that I am a fierce
competitor, citizen and human created by the God of the universe. What more can any of us
hope to get out of life? Learn the lessons that come from every experience, especially if they
come through sports and use your newfound wisdom to impact your world.
PART 2
The sum of lessons learned is the yield they produce in a person's life. I would be lying if I said
that I knew there were twelve truths being forged in my life through adversity from ages 9-30.
I knew that about as much as I knew 30 years ago that I would write this book. Not only was I
oblivious about the lessons but I resisted each one in process. Destructive thoughts coursed
through my mind on countless occasions because of basketball and its perpetual
disappointments. I wanted to physically fight teammates, coaches and anyone who crossed
the tumult of my internal struggle.
But the vindicating conversation with coach following my last college game was only the
beginning of my liberation and discovery that I had something to offer athletics and a host of
other spheres in society. The tryouts for which I sought to play included Germany, Norway,
Bolivia, the Philippines, Brazil and China. From 1997-1999 I hired an agent and pursued all
these ventures with the proverbial "chip on my shoulder." I had something to prove to my
family, my former coaches, former teammates and the world at large. But after the Philippines
team said they needed a bigger player, I sought a human growth hormone specialist. Not
really. I'm not sure they even existed back then. I got on an airplane and took a 13-hour flight
home. That was July and by August I had applied to graduate school. Two years later, I had
finished that degree and three years following, I met an NBA assistant coach via a good
friend's reference and worked out for an NBA team with guys who now make millions of
dollars. I know it seems like I skipped something in the telling of this. I did. The important point
is about vindication. STAY FOCUSED on the main point.
By the time I worked out for an NBA team in 2005 the objective was basic and did not even
resemble the goals from 8 years earlier. I was 29 now, had worked for a church full-time for
four years and was substitute teaching at a local high school. The decision to attempt an NBA
career was incredulous but I trained from November 2004 to June 2005 to prepare. The 12
lessons prepared me, however, long before I ever caught wind of an NBA lead. By 2005 I knew
who I was, someone who played the game of basketball but with a coach's interest. I now
possessed a passion for the ethical transformation of sports and a desire to break into the
realm to help society's elite use their fame for the betterment of the community.
It was strange to use as fuel something that was unrelated to money, personal achievement or
a boyhood fantasy. Imagine two-hour shooting workouts after a full day of work. You're
working on footwork coordination, shooting accuracy on the move, free throwing with fatigue
and sprint conditioning. It was as if the lessons from these pages delivered my opportunity
directly into my hands. Not only had I waited a lifetime for a real look at the NBA but I had
waited just as long to train properly with confidence. I shot thousands of shots with a polished
technique, extending my shooting range to the 3-point line. Running from one baseline to
another was effortless due to superb conditioning on a daily basis. It was not uncommon to
work, play, shoot for two hours, eat dinner, nap and then shoot again from 10 p.m. – midnight.
I became a glutton for sharpness and while I did not have an NBA agent working to help me
secure interest from an NBA franchise, I was confident that my skill level had matured to a
level that far exceeded that of my early twenties.
So is this book about a moral victory obtained in lieu of real success? Maybe it is depending
on how you define success. But if you think dollars, playing time and fame constitute success,
you are as deluded as I was. My guess is that everyone has a book because everyone has
"...Not played basketball." No one wins constantly and even those who win often probably fail
more often. Baseball players who fail 70 percent of the time are paid to fail that often. I never
earned one cent playing basketball but the lessons I learned were released as I serve others.
Humility, personal responsibility, the desire to improve, being coachable and accepting
oneself are among the greatest lessons we can internalize and the sooner the better. I coach,
play and instruct young students and athletes in hopes that they will learn their own set of
lessons. There is such a thing as an honest aspiration, a desire to be or do something that
comes from a healthy awareness of who we are.
Hier sind die Kerngedanken aus dem Buch "The 6ixth Man: 12 Lessons I've Learned From
Not Playing Basketball":
1. SUBMIT TO THE TRUTH
Imagine you are playing a basketball game and your coach is not getting through to the team.
You can tell he is frustrated because every instruction he gives seems to be either ignored or
executed incorrectly by players on the floor. So at the half he goes to the locker room and
puts on his jersey. You don't know what to think. Is he trying it on to see if it fits? Did he spill
something on his polo? And then you realize he is putting on the jersey and some shorts so he
can play in the second half. "But I thought he was the coach," you say. He is but he says to
you, "I gotta show 'em how it's done..."
Submitting to authority is inescapable. If you are an athlete, you have been coached and have
likely coached someone else. However, the roles of coach and player require distinctly
different commitments. The player's role is more that of executioner, setting in motion what
coaches have articulated at practice. [...]
Submission to truth means recognizing what your role is in the situation regardless of how
positive or negative. Some people love accolades while others avoid them. [...] Lying to
yourself is always an attempt to create your own reality and even the rich fail at that.
2. CHECK YOUR MOTIVE
How many ballplayers have you known who "never were"? In other words, you never saw
someone with more athleticism, more ball handling skills, a "wetter" jump shot than
"so-and-so." But "so-and-so" never played one second in a real game with you because he
quit too soon. He did not like how little he was playing - wanted 35 minutes a game instead of
20. He did not expect to be disciplined for violating team rules. So he gets to tell tall tales to
his grandchildren of how some players are just too dominant to grace a high school team with
their expertise.
The "6ixth Man" is a paradigm shift from god that brings clarity and purity to your goal.
Comparing yourself to others, aiming for the spotlight, blaming others for failure and other
character flaws will be addressed in this book with one objective in mind: To convince you that
every encounter yields a lesson and every lesson God teaches us through the team prepares
us for life's most significant demands.
3. PREPARE
As alluded to earlier, I rode enough benches in high school and college to supply a year's
worth of firewood from my buttocks to a small family in Alaska. If there is one thing I learned
from NOT playing basketball it's how to prepare. Are you good at remembering names? Maybe
you are an auditory learner. Can you watch someone do something once and then replicate it?
Maybe you are a visual learner. Do you need to physically perform a task before you feel
confident with the activity? Maybe your learning style is what is known as bodily-kinesthetic.
Knowing how you prefer to learn is important to preparation. What is more important is that
you engage your learning style once you know what it is. [...] I can't speak for other sports but
in college basketball, often times if you do not play in the games, you are probably not playing
in practice scrimmages either. This was the case for me both in college.
4. BLAME YOURSELF FOR SOMETHING
This chapter is about blame and I do not know Elmer G. Letterman but he is quoted as saying,
"A man may fall many times but he won't be a failure until he says someone pushed him."
Funny. There is still a tendency to respond to such wit, "But what if someone really did push
me... isn't that my validation?" It is not validation but rather an excuse to remain mediocre at
best. Blame is a mentality, a way of being and a practice that strips people of the power God
gave them.
The fourth lesson I learned from not playing basketball is that, it's never always someone
else's fault. My college coach stunned me early in my freshman year at a practice when he
told us all that bad passes are the passer's fault. I thought to myself, "What if my guy has
terrible hands or cuts to the basket with his head turned the wrong way? If he drops it, that's
on him right, Coach?" Coach said that he was tired of players blaming other people for their
own poor decisions on the floor.
5. RESOLVE TO COMPETE
An article on https://www.google.com/search?q=Ezinearticles.com said this concerning anger:
"Angry people have a certain perception and expectation of the world that they live in and
when that reality does not meet their expectation of it, then they become angry." (Tristan Loo,
What Causes Anger?)
I learned this truth NOT playing basketball and found that anger is as common as breathing. It
is not said that anger impedes domination by providing us an internal gauge for how much
"crap" we will actually take. But I offer this. Anger in its truest sense must prompt one to
actively improve himself and his environment.
In lieu of being a cancer to the team, I decided that I would hone and utilize my skills to
become a dominant practice player. Make no mistake, I did not want to be a practice player. I
did not dream of telling my grandkids about the time in practice when I ran a sprint or almost
made a shot. But since playing time was outside of my control, I opted to control what I could.
6. RESPECT UP, DOWN & ACROSS
A.C. Green is a name synonymous with integrity in the NBA. He is known by two claims to
fame. The first is that, along with his three championship rings, he holds the Iron Man record
for most consecutive games played – 1192 straight from 1986 to 1999. The second thing that
distinguished A.C. Green from other athletes was his commitment to abstinence before
marriage.
Why is respect for one's opponent needed? It is absolutely necessary because "respect"
makes one cautious. By definition, to respect someone is to acknowledge that he or she
possesses worth, excellence, ability and skill. The acknowledgment is needed information that
should lead to a pursuit of excellence that rivals or exceeds that of the opponent. In other
words, if you respect that your opponent is good, you will prepare yourself well enough to win
no matter who you face.
7. SHOW SOME I.D.
I like when people tell me I am doing a good job at something and in contrast, I hate when
people are displeased with my performance. My college coach often said, "If you don't do
what I'm asking you to do there's only two explanations. Either you refuse to do it or you are
too stupid to do it."
A pastor I once knew said that there are three perceptions of the self: the self others see, the
self you see and the self God sees. He said that only one of these "selfs" really matters. Can
you guess which one? However, in high school, college and beyond I wanted to be known as
an athlete, a premier basketball player.
My perception of my self, the second of the three, was that I was severely underrated and
deserving of more attention... The true self is the third self and the only one that matters.
8. FIND YOUR VALUE
By the time I finished playing college basketball, the statistics compiled by our sports
information director said that I shot better than 52 percent from the field over four years. That
sounds pretty good. If you know anything about hoop you know that making 50 percent of
your shots is a good thing. That stat was misleading however because I probably averaged
less than five minutes per game playing time.
I found my confidence in an area unrelated to basketball but writing played a significant part
in making me the confident person I am today. Whether talking with Chief Executive Officers
of major companies or playing basketball with some kids in Metro Manila, Philippines I have
enjoyed communicating confidently with people from various backgrounds. I bear no shame
about my failed attempts to play in the NBA because I am not defined by one activity anymore.
9. WAIT WITH YOUR HEAD UP
I mentioned earlier that I grew up a Los Angeles Lakers fan and this has not changed. I play
pick-up games wearing crew socks with the Lakers logo on them. [...]
When a player leaves a team at the professional level it often has to do with one of two things:
money and/or an opportunity to win a championship. After being swept in the NBA Finals by
the Houston Rockets in 1995, Shaq undoubtedly desired another chance at a championship.
I learned the lesson of changing teams in the off-season after my opportunity to do so
passed. As is the focus of this book, I learned much from NOT playing basketball but in the
summer of 1995 I was recruited by another college that may have offered me significantly
more playing time. [...] I will never know what would have come of the transfer from one
school to another. Nevertheless, the lesson is simple: Do not let fear determine the moves you
make when new opportunities arise.
10. MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS
The word comparison is often understood as noting the similarities and differences between
two things. Commonly, however, the term compare is used to identify differences between
people that distinguish one of the persons as inferior to the other.
One thing about time that remains constant is that we all have a mere 86,400 seconds
available to us each day. Being rich, pretty or popular will not change this. Time is time and
how you spend it is up to you. This lesson concerns the type of comparisons in which you
engage each day.
Comparisons off the court may sound like this: "I am not as athletic as my brother, I am not as
smart as my sister or I am not musical like my mom." These are just as dangerous as the
calculations I used to make between myself and my high school teammate. The reason is that
you could be enjoying life and each day's 86,400 seconds if you were not so busy devaluing
yourself.
11. DON'T CONFUSE THE AUDIENCE
Another lesson I learned from not playing basketball is that people are watching you all the
time whether you consider yourself important or not. You've found that people are always
looking for role models, ways to improve. It is as if they're looking at themselves by comparing
themselves to you.
My first example comes from eighth grade Pop Warner Football. I lived in south Los Angeles.
[...] The lady we lived with had a chain-link fence surrounding her home and whenever I was
leaving her front yard, I would leap over the fence rather than open it. It was a challenge and I
at least "wowed" myself with each leap. Little did I know that Mr. Porter across the street was
watching.
Throughout my life I have found that people watch you constantly and often see the good to
which you are oblivious.
12. BE VERIFIED BY TENACITY
At last I submit the last of the 12 lessons I learned from NOT playing basketball. If you do not
quit, the truth of who you are will be proven – verified. I learned one of my most notable
lessons about life from an encounter I had with my coach after the last game of my college
career. It is actually a difficult thing to recount because of how desperately I wanted to excel
in basketball as a young person.
The question I had always asked myself from childhood to adulthood was, "Am I a good
basketball player?" In my mind there was only one thing that determined the answer to this
question – playing time. If you do not play, I thought, you are a worthless athlete who should
not be issued a uniform.
But the vindicating conversation with coach following my last college game was only the
beginning of my liberation and discovery that I had something to offer athletics and a host of
other spheres in society. [...] The important point is about vindication. STAY FOCUSED on the
main point.
